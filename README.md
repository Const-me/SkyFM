# SkyFMInitially, I’ve developed this for Windows Phone 7.5.The app got 140k+ downloaded, the average rating being 4.5 / 5.Eventually, Microsoft updated their API or something, and removed my app from their store.I haven’t earned a single buck of that app. That’s why I’m not willing to update it, instead, I’m sharing the source code.The most interesting parts of my code is audio streaming.I.e. how to deal with crappy networks (the buffering is OK here, much better than the rest of audio streaming apps I’ve used so far), how to get metadata from shoutcast stream, how to feed those audio frames to the OS-provided hardware decoder…Those parts are implemented in SkyFM.agent assembly. The code supports MP3 and HE-AAC streams. Only HTTP transport is supported.The app's GUI is translated to Spanish, Japanese and Chinese languages.As you see from the license, the code is free to reuse in commercial applications. And I hope you’ll do so, as audio streaming apps I’m using now ain’t exceptionally tolerant to mediocre-quality networks.
